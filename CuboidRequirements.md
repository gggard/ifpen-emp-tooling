To be able to compile, generate and run this sample project smoothly, you should have a working [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-classic-372/indigosr2) environment like this:
  * Java 1.6+
  * Eclipse Indigo (3.7.2)
  * EEF 1.1
  * Acceleo 3
  * EMF 2.7

You also need to import in your workspace a [JOGL v2 library binary build](https://github.com/WadeWalker) compatible with your platform. This is available as an archive file containing Eclipse plugins in the Downloads area.

To compile and run the sample project after the source download, you just need the EEF runtime plugin installed and the JOGL v2 library in your workspace.
