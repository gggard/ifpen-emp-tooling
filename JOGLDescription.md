[JOGL](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) is Java binding for [OpenGL](http://www.khronos.org/opengl) 3D graphics API and is actively developed by [JogAmp Community](http://jogamp.org/).
In addition to the [OpenGL API](http://www.opengl.org/), [JOGL](http://jogamp.org/jogl/www/) also provides a platform independent implementation of a lightweight framework to manage OpenGL rendering context and windowing. It's this framework named NEWT that will be used in this work.

One of the great advantages of using JOGL, as its [version 2](http://jogamp.org/wiki/index.php/Jogamp_Versioning_and_Releases), is the support for all the major development platforms: JOGL runs on Windows, Linux (and more generally X11), MacOS X and Android and supports up to [GLES4 version](http://www.opengl.org/documentation/current_version/) with backward compatibility with older GL specifications.
