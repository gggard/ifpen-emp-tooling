[Extended Editing Framework (EEF)](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/?project=eef) is a project proposed and initiated by [Obeo](http://www.obeo.fr/), originally used to create graphical user interfaces for more effective editing of [EMF](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/) models. It is now an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) component in its own right, integrated in the [EMFT (EMF Technology)](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/) project and used as an incubator for components destined to become part of the [EMF project](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/).

EEF, as its [version 1.1](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EEF/Installation_Guide), provides a generative components and runtime infrastructure composed of three parts:
  * a runtime containing a set of advanced widgets and a generic and extensible MVC architecture
  * standard metamodels allowing the definition of models that will parameterize the actual editing components that are to be generated
  * an Acceleo module generating a standard architecture extending the framework runtime
The generated elements can be of two kinds (Properties View or Editor) and can be integrated in any [SWT](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/) and/or [JFace](http://wiki.eclipse.org/JFace) components to ease the EMF model based editing.

**EEF for Properties view.** The original version of EEF allowed enhancement of the Eclipse Properties view, used to edit EMF entities, in order to offer improved and more varied graphical components. EEF allows construction of a multi tabs view, management of lists and different simple data types, etc.

**Extended EEF.** EEF has been extended to generate EMF model instance editors. The principle consists in creating an Ecore business model, for example by using the [EcoreTool modeler](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emft/?project=ecoretools), and automatically generates a form like editor to create and modify instances of this model. This editor represents model instances by mapping concepts to containers and attributes to widgets inside those containers.

The EEF [User Guide](http://wiki.eclipse.org/EEF/User_Guide) describes how EEF is working and also how to customize graphical user interfaces that are generated by EEF.
